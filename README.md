### Welcome to my GitHub Profile ðŸ‘‹
Hi, Iâ€™m Ivo. Iâ€™m a driven and detail-oriented individual with a passion for software engineering and creating great developer experiences.
#### About me
I have a Master's and Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from the Polytechnic of Leiria, plus I've done some research at CIIC â€“ the Computer Science and Communication Research Centre at the Polytechnic of Leiria. This has given me a good grounding in software engineering, architecture, dataset building and AI/ML.
#### My interests
I'm really into software engineering, effective tooling and clean code. I'm pretty good at Java, Go and SQL, and I'm always looking to improve my technical skills.
When I'm not coding, you can find me reading or bouldering.
