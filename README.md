## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Ivo Bispo**, a full-stack engineer with a focus on backend development. I specialize in enhancing developer experience and building efficient, scalable tooling. My passion lies in solving complex problemsâ€” the more challenging, the more rewardingâ€”while ensuring that everything is thoroughly tested to deliver high-quality, reliable features.

With my experience across the full stack, I have an understanding of frontend challenges, and I design backends that simplify these complexities. This allows frontend developers to focus on delivering polished, user-centered features, as the intricate logic is managed behind the API.

Ultimately, my goal is to ship software that not only meets but exceeds expectations, blending technical expertise with a focus on problem-solving to drive project success.
