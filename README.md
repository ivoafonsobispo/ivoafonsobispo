hey ðŸ‘‹ <br><br>

i'm a full-stack engineer and former researcher specializing in backend and AI/ML engineering. i build systems that handle complex logic behind APIs, so the frontend can focus on great user experiences. i strive for efficient, scalable, and reliable software.

i tend to live in the terminal and editor, but when i'm not there, you'll find me reading or cooking.
