Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm a software engineer and former AI researcher specializing in backend microservices that integrate AI solutions.

I focus on building scalable, efficient, and reliable systems that handle complex logic behind APIs, enabling seamless front-end development.

With full-stack experience, I bridge the gap between front-end challenges and backend solutions, ensuring smooth integration.

My goal is to deliver software that exceeds expectations, combining strong architecture with problem-solving expertise to drive success.
