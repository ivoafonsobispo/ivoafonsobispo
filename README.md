### Welcome to my GitHub Profile ðŸ‘‹
#### About me
I've got a Master's and Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Polytechnic of Leiria, and I've also worked as a Researcher at CIIC. That's given me a solid foundation in software engineering, architecture, dataset building and AI/ML.
#### My interests
I'm really into software engineering, effective tooling and clean code. I'm pretty good at Java, Go and SQL, and I'm always looking to brush up on my technical skills.
When I'm not coding, I'm usually reading or bouldering.
